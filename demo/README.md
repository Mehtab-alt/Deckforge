# DeckForge Phases 9-10 Demo

This demo folder contains a visual simulation of the DeckForge platform's advanced capabilities for Phases 9 (Autonomous SRE) and Phase 10 (Multi-Cloud Federation).

## Contents

- `visual_demo.py` - Interactive visual demonstration of the complete DeckForge workflow
- This README file

## Features Demonstrated

The visual demo simulates:

1. **Monitoring System Activity** - Detecting infrastructure issues
2. **Incident Ingestion Gateway** - Processing alerts and creating incident records
3. **Autonomous Investigation** - Performing secure diagnostics via SSH
4. **AI Decision Engine** - Analyzing data and recommending actions
5. **Slack ChatOps Integration** - Providing human approval workflow
6. **Automated Remediation** - Executing Ansible runbooks
7. **Multi-Cloud Federation** - Mapping resources across cloud providers
8. **Incident Resolution** - Completing the incident lifecycle
9. **Dashboard Summary** - Showing system metrics and status

## How to Run

Execute the demo with Python:

```
python demo/visual_demo.py
```

## Purpose

This demo provides a visual representation of how DeckForge operates as an Event-Driven, Intent-Based Intelligence System that can:
- Ingest system alerts via secure gateway
- Investigate issues with non-destructive diagnostics
- Propose remediation via verified runbooks
- Provide Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) safety net via Slack
- Abstract multi-cloud complexity

The simulation shows the complete workflow without requiring actual infrastructure, demonstrating the platform's evolution from static generator to intelligent SRE system.
